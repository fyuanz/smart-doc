# Project Instructions

## Mandatory First Read

Before analyzing, planning, or modifying code, read these files when they exist:

1. `docs/codex/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. `docs/codex/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
3. `docs/codex/MODULES.md`
4. `docs/codex/TASKS.md`
5. `docs/codex/DECISIONS.md`

Do not scan the whole repository before reading these files. Use targeted `rg` searches afterward.

## Development Rules

- Write tests before implementation and keep the red to green sequence.
- Keep source and test files below approximately 800-1000 lines; split files by responsibility before they become larger.
- Prefer decisions that are verifiable and maintainable.

## Documentation Updates

When a change affects documented facts, update the relevant `docs/codex/` files in the same task:

- Always update `TASKS.md` when task status changes.
- Update `DECISIONS.md` when a technical decision is proposed, accepted, rejected, or superseded.
- Update `MODULES.md` or `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` when responsibilities or paths change.
- Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` when goals, users, workflows, commands, status, or constraints change.

## Verification

Run checks appropriate to the change and report them. If verification cannot run, explain why.

## Milestone Delivery

- After completing an independently reviewable part of the user's requested work, run appropriate verification, update the project docs, then commit and push to the configured GitHub remote without asking for confirmation again.
- Commit changes belonging to that completed work; do not include unrelated edits, secrets, generated build output, or temporary files.
- Use normal pushes. Do not force-push or overwrite remote history. If the remote is missing, authentication fails, or integration requires user input, finish the local work and report the specific blocker.
- This is the delivery workflow for requested work, not a schedule or authorization to start additional product stages autonomously.
