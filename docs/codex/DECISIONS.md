# Decisions

Current scope: product design v3.4.0, the compile-update decision, and the 2026-09-09 service/document decision below govern current work. Earlier decisions describe history; ZIP/download, CLI and package identity are deferred. The user-selected standalone Spring Boot fixture is now implemented; it is not a production dependency.

## 2026-09-09 - Remove The Project-Local Documentation Skill

Status: Accepted

The user requested removal of skills installed inside this project. Remove the documentation skill and its bundled templates and metadata. Retain `AGENTS.md` and `docs/codex/` as the direct project guidance and context, with no installed documentation skill dependency. This supersedes the earlier skill installation decision and does not change the product's API-to-Skill generation scope.

## 2026-09-07 - Initialize Git with a main primary branch

Status: Accepted

Context:

- The project had no Git repository or repository-level ignore rules.

Decision:

- Initialize the repository with `main` as the primary branch.
- Ignore Maven build output, Java compiler artifacts, IDE metadata, local environment files, logs, temporary files, and operating-system metadata.
- Do not ignore JAR files globally because JAR inputs and fixtures are part of the SmartDoc-Agent domain.

Consequences:

- Source, documentation, schemas, and potential JAR fixtures remain trackable.
- Generated Maven `target/` directories and machine-local files stay out of commits.

Alternatives considered:

- Ignore all `*.jar` files. Rejected because that could hide intentional test fixtures or sample inputs.

## 2026-09-07 - Separate mandatory project guidance from the documentation Skill

Status: Superseded by the 2026-09-09 removal of the project-local documentation skill; root guidance remains in effect.

Context:

- A `SKILL.md` stored directly under `docs/` is not in Codex's repository Skill discovery path.
- Implicit Skill activation depends on task matching and should not be the only mechanism for mandatory instructions.

Decision:

- Store the reusable documentation workflow at `.agents/skills/ai-project-docs/`.
- Store always-on first-read and development rules in the repository-root `AGENTS.md`.
- Use the Skill to create or refresh documentation, while ordinary development follows `AGENTS.md` and updates only documents whose facts changed.

Consequences:

- Codex can discover the Skill from the repository root and subdirectories.
- Every task receives the first-read instructions without forcing the complete documentation workflow to run.
- Templates and UI metadata remain self-contained inside the Skill directory.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep `docs/SKILL.md` and rely on agents to search for it. Rejected because the location is not automatically discoverable as a repository Skill.
- Force the complete Skill on every task. Rejected because it would add unnecessary documentation gates to routine code changes.

## 2026-09-07 - Preserve the original SmartDoc-Agent architecture

Status: Superseded

Context:

- `docs/smartdoc-agent-design.md` records the reviewed product and architecture direction.

Decision:

- Originally use Java 17 and Maven modules.
- Originally use bytecode and optional source inputs normalized into deterministic IR.
- Originally use build-time knowledge generation with local runtime retrieval and a probe fallback.

Consequences:

- The Java 17 and Maven foundation remains useful.
- The bytecode/source/probe product architecture was superseded by the accepted OpenAPI-first decision below before its parsers or runtime components were implemented.
- Existing v1 IR records remain legacy code only until the first v2 test-driven replacement task.

Alternatives considered:

- Refer to `docs/smartdoc-agent-design.md` for the detailed ADR alternatives and rationale.

## 2026-09-08 - Adopt an OpenAPI-first sidecar architecture

Status: Superseded

Superseded by the direct Skill compilation decision and the later generated OpenAPI 3.1.0 input decision. OpenAPI-first remains the direction, but this ADR's URL-acquisition and broad-version scope is no longer current.

Current scope note: the v3.2 MVP preserves OpenAPI-first input and the removal of source/bytecode/runtime probing, and accepts one frozen local JSON file per build whose root marker is exact OpenAPI 3.1.0. Swagger 2.0, other versions/formats, external references, and URL acquisition are deferred.

Context:

- RuoYi and similar services already expose a machine-readable Swagger/OpenAPI contract.
- Parsing source or bytecode would duplicate existing framework work while still failing to describe all externally observable HTTP behavior.
- The requested integration must not modify existing controllers or business APIs.

Decision:

- Treat frozen Swagger 2.0/OpenAPI 3.x specifications as the primary HTTP contract input.
- Acquire specifications from explicit files or approved URLs in a sidecar build workflow.
- Default URL acquisition to public HTTPS; allow loopback/private RuoYi endpoints only through an explicit, narrowly scoped network profile that pins scheme, host, port, and resolved IP/CIDR and rejects redirects or DNS rebinding outside that scope.
- Remove source parsing, bytecode parsing, decompilation, embedded runtime SDK, and runtime probes from product scope.
- Retain Java 17 and Maven as the implementation foundation.

Consequences:

- The first implementation unit is operation/schema/evidence normalization rather than class/method IR.
- The current six v1 IR records and schema will be replaced without a compatibility layer because no released consumer exists.
- The system can integrate with RuoYi without changing its API, but cannot infer facts absent or incorrect in OpenAPI.

Alternatives considered:

- Continue the ASM/source dual-channel design. Rejected because it is more invasive and expensive and is less aligned with the public API contract.
- Scrape Swagger UI HTML. Rejected because the UI is an unstable presentation layer while JSON/YAML is the machine contract.

## 2026-09-08 - Compile multiple governed knowledge sources into one Bundle

Status: Superseded

Superseded by the direct Skill package decision below.

Context:

- OpenAPI describes HTTP transport well but does not fully cover business workflows, troubleshooting, Excel layout, or Shapefile structure.
- Teams already maintain useful software and API usage documentation.

Decision:

- Support explicitly managed Markdown documents with versioned source rules and front matter.
- Support reviewed structured overlays for Excel, Shapefile, and audited HTTP-contract corrections.
- Use field-specific authority: OpenAPI owns HTTP facts, domain overlays own domain contracts, reviewed documents own guidance, and AI content is lowest-authority derived material.
- Preserve provenance for every indexed unit and reject stale, dangling, or conflicting protected facts in strict builds.
- Preserve applied ContractCorrection records and their original/effective values in the Bundle instead of only baking replacements into normalized operations.

Consequences:

- Users can add their own documentation without modifying service code.
- Rules must remain limited to inclusion, binding, classification, explanation, domain contracts, narrowly typed reviewed `ContractCorrection` records, and display; arbitrary patching is not an MVP feature.
- Managed document content is treated as untrusted evidence, not as agent instructions.

Alternatives considered:

- Index all repository files automatically. Rejected because it creates noise, leaks unintended content, and weakens provenance.
- Let Markdown or AI silently override OpenAPI fields. Rejected because it makes results order-dependent and unverifiable.

## 2026-09-08 - Use structured retrieval before optional vector retrieval

Status: Superseded

Superseded by the direct Skill package decision below; no retrieval engine is in the current MVP.

Context:

- OpenAPI is identifier-rich and graph-structured.
- Exact route, operation, permission, schema, and field queries are better served by deterministic indexes.
- The reviewed sample becomes small when split by operation and its referenced schema closure.

Decision:

- Build exact maps, structured filters, a Chinese-friendly BM25 index, and a relation graph during Bundle construction.
- At query time, retrieve candidate operations/documents first and only then expand the required schema/document closure.
- Keep vector search behind an optional `SemanticReranker` interface and enable it only after offline evaluation proves a stable gain.
- Enforce a default 12,000-token hard limit for retrieved evidence supplied to an LLM.

Consequences:

- MVP has no vector database or mandatory embedding model.
- TypeScript generation follows the schema graph directly and never uses RAG or an LLM.
- Low-confidence queries return candidates or abstain instead of guessing.

Alternatives considered:

- Always embed the complete OpenAPI. Rejected because it adds cost and version coupling without solving exact lookup, cyclic references, or contract quality problems.
- Put the complete OpenAPI in every prompt. Rejected because it wastes context and scales poorly.

## 2026-09-08 - Make deterministic offline builds the default

Status: Superseded

Superseded as a Bundle/AI-cache design. The narrower direct Skill build remains deterministic and offline under the current decision below.

Context:

- Repeated package builds must not regenerate unchanged AI documentation or consume tokens.
- CI needs reproducible artifacts and clear network boundaries.

Decision:

- Separate `snapshot`, deterministic `validate/build/verify`, and explicit `enrich --allow-ai` operations.
- Default SmartDoc builds use `reuse-only` mode and never fetch business sources, invoke documented APIs, or call an LLM. Maven/toolchain dependency resolution is outside this runtime boundary; the release offline gate uses pre-provisioned locked dependencies and `mvn -o` under network denial.
- Cache optional AI artifacts by canonical unit, dependency closure, overlay, prompt, model, locale, and policy digest.
- Store stable canonical EvidenceAnchors in reusable AI content artifacts, then deterministically bind them to the current snapshot evidence IDs when assembling a Bundle; an evidence-ID change alone must not force another model call.
- Publish immutable, checksummed Knowledge Bundles; pin each session to one concrete bundle ID.

Consequences:

- Unchanged inputs produce zero LLM calls and zero AI tokens.
- Partial changes invalidate only affected units and their dependent summaries.
- Bundle import cannot trigger hidden generation.

Alternatives considered:

- Invoke AI automatically during every Maven package. Rejected because it is costly, nondeterministic, and requires network access in ordinary builds.
- Mutate a published knowledge database in place. Rejected because it prevents reliable rollback and session reproducibility.

## 2026-09-08 - Provide an independent grounded-chat service

Status: Superseded

Superseded by the direct Skill package decision below; AI chat is deferred until after real Skill usage validation.

Context:

- Users need a conversation window to ask how features, API parameters, Excel files, and Shapefiles should be used.
- Browser clients must not receive LLM credentials or the complete unrestricted knowledge corpus.

Decision:

- Implement a separate Spring Boot service that imports verified Bundles, exposes search/evidence/TypeScript/session APIs, and serves a minimal built-in web page.
- Filter access before retrieval, pack only relevant evidence, require citations, and abstain when evidence is insufficient.
- Keep the MVP read-only; it explains and generates code but never invokes the documented business APIs.

Consequences:

- The same Bundle powers the web page, API, and separately exported Agent Skill sidecar.
- Local use can bind to loopback; shared use requires an authentication/authorization adapter.
- Actual API execution, workflow automation, and write-operation confirmation remain separate future decisions.

Alternatives considered:

- Embed a runtime SDK into every target application. Rejected because a separate service is easier to update, secure, and reuse.
- Let the browser call the LLM directly. Rejected because it exposes credentials and weakens evidence and access controls.

## 2026-09-08 - Adopt Skill-first developer delivery and defer Agent plugins

Status: Superseded

Superseded as a Bundle-derived export/install design. Skill-first delivery remains, but the current product generates the Skill ZIP directly and uses manual installation.

Context:

- Opening a fresh conversation is convenient but repeatedly requires developers to restore project and API context.
- Frontend developers need a directly installable, version-pinned knowledge artifact after a backend/API release.
- A platform plugin can provide live tools and runtime authorization, but generating or republishing one for every business build would couple tool lifecycle, permissions, and project knowledge unnecessarily.
- Storing an installable Skill inside its source Bundle would either prevent it from naming the final `bundleId` or create a digest self-reference; prebuilding every audience profile would also make export policy changes alter Bundle identity.

Decision:

- Make an OpenAPI-only Codex project Skill part of MVP-1B, after the canonical Bundle, search, and TypeScript foundations; extend it with managed documents, domain rules, and multiple policy profiles in MVP-2.
- Generate each installable Skill as a deterministic sidecar from a freshly verified immutable Bundle and an explicit, versioned export-profile file. Do not store Skill payloads or export profiles inside the source Bundle.
- Pin `projectId`, `releaseVersion`, `knowledgeId`, exact `sourceBundleId`, export-policy digest, target adapter, security metadata, payload digests, and `skillPackageId` in the package manifest and project-level `smartdoc.skills.lock.json`.
- Support only explicit, offline Codex project installation/update in MVP. Builds and exports never mutate developer projects, installation never follows `latest`, and local drift is not overwritten implicitly.
- Generate the Agent instruction surface only from trusted fixed templates; untrusted source and AI text may appear only in filtered references.
- Apply dependency-closed export filtering. Static-package authorization ends at export and controlled distribution; installed files are not protected by Server ACL.
- Do not create an Agent-platform plugin/MCP connector in MVP-1/2. If Production later needs dynamic revocation, cross-project search, or runtime ACL, consider one separately versioned, knowledge-free connector whose every request names an exact `bundleId` and never silently falls back to `latest`.

Consequences:

- Web developers can install a reviewed API knowledge snapshot directly in their repository and use it without a running SmartDoc Server or model credential.
- Bundle, Skill, and any future connector have separate identities and release cadences; one Bundle can produce multiple audience-specific packages without changing `bundleId`.
- Export, package verification, safe atomic installation, drift detection, lock maintenance, trusted-template generation, and Codex discovery become MVP-1B acceptance work.
- A copied static Skill cannot be revoked dynamically; restricted packages require classification labels, controlled artifact distribution, and repository/filesystem protection.

Alternatives considered:

- Generate a new Agent plugin for every business build. Rejected because it couples permissions and runtime tooling to fast-changing knowledge and adds unnecessary installation and compatibility overhead.
- Put generated Skill payloads inside the canonical Bundle. Rejected because post-Bundle identity, per-audience export, and independent target-adapter evolution are cleaner and more verifiable as sidecars.
- Defer all Skill work until the session service. Rejected because an OpenAPI-only project Skill delivers the primary developer workflow earlier and remains useful offline.

## 2026-09-08 - Narrow the product to direct Skill compilation and immutable download

Status: Superseded

Context:

- Swagger UI already provides a suitable human-facing rendering of the API contract.
- The immediate developer need is not a general knowledge platform; it is an LLM-friendly, downloadable project Skill derived from the same OpenAPI.
- The previous design combined canonical Knowledge Bundles, multiple governed sources, search, TypeScript generation, Skill export and installation, RAG, and a session service before any v2 implementation or test existed.
- That combined scope created disproportionate implementation, security, evaluation, and operational risk.

Decision:

- Define the current product as an OpenAPI-to-Codex-Skill compiler plus a minimal read-only package download service.
- Use one frozen local OpenAPI file as the MVP source and never scrape Swagger UI HTML.
- Generate one directly installable Skill ZIP containing trusted-template instructions, a compact catalog, and separate tag, operation, and shared Schema references.
- Preserve local `$ref` edges and render recursive relationships as links rather than recursively expanding complete Schema closures.
- Make the Skill ZIP the only current product artifact; do not introduce a separate Knowledge Bundle.
- Keep builds local, deterministic, and free of LLM, business-API, or external-reference network calls.
- Publish only verified immutable packages, addressed by exact `projectId`, `releaseVersion`, and `skillPackageId`.
- Make installation a manual developer action in MVP. The product does not modify consuming projects.
- Defer search, RAG, AI enrichment, chat UI, TypeScript, managed documents, automatic installation, and broader format compatibility until real usage demonstrates a need.

Consequences:

- The first implementation has three primary hard problems: safe OpenAPI splitting, correct local Schema-reference navigation, and deterministic verifiable packaging.
- The server becomes a small artifact distributor rather than a knowledge runtime.
- Existing accepted decisions for multiple-source Bundles, structured retrieval, independent grounded chat, and Bundle-derived automatic Skill installation are superseded for the current product.
- Deterministic offline behavior remains, but only for direct Skill generation and verification; the previous Bundle and AI-cache identity system is removed.
- At the time of this decision, the exact OpenAPI version still required confirmation. The later generated OpenAPI 3.1.0 input decision resolves it as exact `openapi: 3.1.0` for the current MVP.
- Future capabilities require separate accepted decisions and must not be pre-built as speculative extension modules.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep the full knowledge compiler and session-service roadmap. Rejected because it solves several unvalidated future problems before delivering the primary developer workflow.
- Build an AI chat page first. Rejected because it adds model, retrieval, citation, ACL, and evaluation complexity before the Skill content and splitting strategy are validated.
- Parse rendered Swagger UI pages. Rejected because presentation HTML is less stable and less complete than the underlying machine-readable OpenAPI contract.
- Let the server generate packages on demand. Rejected for MVP because offline CI generation and read-only distribution are easier to test, secure, cache, and operate.

## 2026-09-08 - Support OpenAPI 3.1 And Swagger 2.0 With Pinned RuoYi Fixtures

Status: Superseded

Superseded by the generated OpenAPI 3.1.0 input decision below after the producer boundary was clarified.

Context:

- The product scope is already limited to compiling one frozen API contract into one Skill ZIP and distributing verified packages.
- The target input range is now explicitly OpenAPI 3.1.0 and Swagger 2.0 rather than one still-unknown first protocol.
- A realistic project fixture is needed to validate splitting, shared schemas, Chinese tags, authentication, common response wrappers, uploads, and deterministic package behavior at useful scale.
- RuoYi is a project family whose current and historical releases use different documentation stacks; a floating branch or an assumed dependency-to-spec mapping would not be a reproducible fixture.

Decision:

- Make `openapi-3.1-json` and `swagger-2.0-json` first-class MVP source profiles. Each build still consumes exactly one frozen local JSON file.
- Accept OpenAPI 3.1.x as one feature set, while requiring the first OpenAPI project-level fixture to declare exact `openapi: 3.1.0`; require Swagger input to declare exact `swagger: "2.0"`.
- Require an explicit source profile and cross-check it against the root marker. Do not auto-detect, silently switch, or rewrite protocol versions.
- Implement two thin source adapters that normalize into one minimal model. Reference graph construction, Markdown rendering, Skill packaging, verification, CLI, and download service remain shared.
- Preserve source-specific semantics and JSON Pointers. In particular, do not first convert Swagger 2.0 into OpenAPI 3.1 and risk losing body/formData, consumes/produces, collectionFormat, reusable response, or security-definition details.
- Use the official `yangzongzhuan/RuoYi-Vue` project family for both project-level fixtures:
  - OpenAPI baseline: v3.9.2, commit `0e2d75c23c0d7a1fa85f660f06a59a4dd1ba14c0`, captured from a versioned test-only `full` group and admitted only if the root marker is exact 3.1.0.
  - Swagger baseline: v3.5.0, commit `5e64a93d115cfc65ef76eb0e4612d9a313448e29`, captured from `/v2/api-docs` and admitted only if the root marker is exact 2.0.
- Commit only frozen, sanitized, attributed snapshots with source URL, tag, full commit, startup/capture procedure, root marker, raw/sanitized digests, license notice, sanitization changes, test-only overlay, and expected size/count metadata.
- Keep small synthetic fixtures for profile conformance, cross-profile equivalence, recursion, dangling/external references, unsupported keywords, limits, and hostile free text. RuoYi complements rather than replaces edge-case tests.
- Keep OpenAPI 3.0, YAML, URL acquisition, and external `$ref` outside the MVP.
- This decision supersedes only the single-OpenAPI-3.1-profile assumption in the direct Skill compilation decision; the Skill-only artifact, deterministic offline build, manual installation, read-only download, and deferred chat scope remain unchanged.

Consequences:

- MVP adds one bounded parsing adapter and profile-specific conformance tests, not a second rendering or delivery pipeline.
- The normalized model must include a small security-scheme representation and preserve dialect-specific source metadata needed by generated references.
- Fixture acquisition is a release gate: library versions may select a candidate but cannot prove the emitted specification version.
- Tests do not start RuoYi or access GitHub/Gitee; they consume committed snapshots only.
- Package identity includes source profile, declared version, raw source digest, and original pointers, so semantically equivalent 3.1/2.0 inputs need not produce the same package ID.

Alternatives considered:

- Support only OpenAPI 3.1 and defer Swagger 2.0. Rejected because Swagger 2.0 is an explicit target and is represented by real RuoYi deployments.
- Maintain two complete compiler pipelines. Rejected because all behavior after dialect normalization is shared and duplicated implementations would drift.
- Use only a large RuoYi fixture. Rejected because a real project does not reliably cover malformed inputs, recursion, profile mismatches, or every dialect-specific edge.
- Test against a live RuoYi branch or endpoint. Rejected because upstream drift and network/runtime dependencies would make tests slow and irreproducible.

## 2026-09-08 - Treat Generated OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON As The Sole Current Input

Status: Accepted

Scope amendment: the OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON/core boundary remains accepted. The v3.3 compile-update decision below supersedes manual production snapshot refresh, mandatory testbed-first work, deterministic ZIPs, and immutable downloads. Production freshness must be established for each compilation; frozen fixtures remain appropriate for core tests.

v3.4 amendment: the single-document-per-build limit is superseded. One service update accepts one or more required OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON documents, parsed independently with document-local references.

Context:

- The target service uses springdoc-openapi 2.8.15 to generate its machine-readable API description.
- Knife4j is an enhanced presentation/integration layer around the OpenAPI document and is not the data contract SmartDoc needs to compile.
- SmartDoc's goal is to convert an already generated API document into an LLM-friendly Skill, not to test documentation UIs, reproduce framework scanning, or certify every historical specification version.
- The proposed RuoYi and Swagger 2.0 fixture matrix added producer and compatibility work that is unnecessary for the first usable product.

Decision:

- Make one frozen local JSON document with exact root marker `openapi: 3.1.0` the sole current compiler input.
- Treat the resulting JSON bytes as the authority. Core has no dependency on Spring Boot, springdoc internals, Knife4j, Swagger UI, or the running business application.
- Use one small standalone Spring Boot fixture producer with Java 17, a pinned compatible Spring Boot 3.5.x patch, and `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-api:2.8.15`.
- Do not add Knife4j or a Swagger UI starter to the testbed. Set `springdoc.api-docs.version=OPENAPI_3_1`, expose representative controllers, and capture `/v3/api-docs` on loopback only during explicit fixture generation or refresh.
- Commit the generated JSON plus exact dependency versions, capture command, root-version assertion, SHA-256, and operation/Schema counts. Ordinary core tests consume the frozen file and do not start Spring Boot.
- Cover path/query/header parameters, JSON and multipart requests, multiple responses, shared/recursive schemas, security, examples, and Chinese tags in the one testbed.
- Keep only small hand-written negative JSON fixtures for states a valid generator will not normally emit, such as dangling/external references, configured limit violations, unsupported versions, and hostile free text. These are data files, not additional sample projects.
- Defer Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0, other OpenAPI 3.1 patch versions, YAML, and producer/UI-specific compatibility tests.
- This decision supersedes the dual-profile and pinned-RuoYi fixture decision. It does not change direct Skill generation, deterministic packaging, manual installation, immutable download, or the decision to leave AI chat until last.

Consequences:

- The current parser, fixture set, and acceptance matrix become substantially smaller.
- Knife4j can be added, removed, or upgraded by a source application without affecting SmartDoc, provided the frozen `/v3/api-docs` JSON remains within the accepted contract.
- The testbed verifies that SmartDoc sees realistic springdoc output; it does not attempt to test or reimplement springdoc itself.
- Supporting another document version later requires an explicit fixture-backed decision, not speculative adapter code now.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep RuoYi as the primary fixture. Rejected because it brings database, security, configuration, release, and upstream-drift variables that do not improve validation of the document-to-Skill compiler.
- Include Knife4j in the testbed. Rejected because UI behavior is outside the product input boundary and the API-only springdoc starter already exposes the required JSON endpoint.
- Start the Spring Boot testbed in every core test. Rejected because a committed snapshot is faster, deterministic, and sufficient for parser tests; the producer is only needed when refreshing the representative fixture.
- Continue testing Swagger 2.0 now. Rejected because it is not part of the clarified target input and would double compatibility work before the main workflow exists.


## 2026-09-08 - Require Per-Compilation Skill Updates Without Blocking The Business Build

Status: Accepted

Context:

- The user defines the sole current product goal as generating an API Skill for frontend development.
- Every compilation must update the Skill, and generation exceptions must not interrupt compilation. All other work is deferred.
- v3.2 emphasized frozen-input conversion, deterministic ZIPs, immutable downloads, and manual installation but did not define compilation integration or non-blocking failure handling.

Decision:

- Restrict current work to API-document conversion, usable Skill content, compilation-triggered updates, and the checks required to make those updates correct and safe.
- Preserve the OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON input boundary and trusted-template/reference separation.
- Require each configured compile invocation to attempt an update, including repeated no-change compilations. Identical API content may generate identical output.
- Coordinate current-document preparation and Skill conversion within the same update flow. Failed preparation must not fall back to an old JSON and claim current-code synchronization.
- Stage and validate a complete result before replacing the generator-owned output. Failed updates retain the previous complete Skill when one exists and clearly report stale/no-output status.
- Isolate Skill configuration, preparation, conversion, timeout, and filesystem errors at the compilation boundary. Emit warnings and preserve the business build's own outcome; never suppress normal business compilation failures.
- Retain basic resource/path limits, reference correctness, source metadata, external update status, and meaningful tests. Defer ZIP packaging, package identity, standalone CLI, download service, deployment, and cross-project installation management.
- A standalone Spring Boot fixture producer is no longer a prerequisite. Start core tests with sanitized JSON and add a minimal integration fixture only when needed to verify actual document production.
- Do not implement other product capabilities in this task or add speculative extension modules.

Consequences:

- Product design v3.3.0 and the documentation pack replace the old ZIP/download implementation roadmap.
- The first integration question is how the target compile obtains a current contract, not how to publish a package.
- Source digests identify input bytes; they cannot prove current-code freshness by themselves.
- The current repository cannot yet demonstrate the required behavior: core files are deleted, the parent cannot load the missing core POM, and no target build/document configuration is present.
- Maven/IDE entry-point coverage, exact ordering, timeout isolation, and replacement behavior require integration tests before implementation is called complete.
- Process termination or failure to load Maven/plugin infrastructure is outside what an executing generator can catch.

Alternatives considered:

- Retain immutable ZIP/download MVP stages. Rejected for current scope because distribution infrastructure is not required for the specified generation workflow.
- Recompile a manually frozen old snapshot every time. Rejected as proof of current-code synchronization; valid only when the static file is itself the authoritative contract.
- Fail the business build on invalid documentation. Rejected because the user explicitly requires generation failures not to interrupt compilation.
- Catch the entire business build or force its exit code to zero. Rejected because genuine business compilation failures must remain visible.
- Write generated files over the previous output in place. Rejected because a failed run can leave an incomplete Skill and removed APIs can remain as stale files.

## 2026-09-08 - Use A Thin Maven Integration For The First Compile-Update Slice

Status: Proposed

Context:

- The repository currently uses Java 17 and a Maven parent.
- A separate manual CLI does not satisfy the compilation trigger requirement.

Decision:

- Propose `smartdoc-agent-core` plus a thin `smartdoc-agent-maven-plugin` as the initial implementation boundary.
- Verify the actual lifecycle binding and current-document preparation order with the target compile workflow before accepting the integration as complete.
- Propose `target/smartdoc/<skillName>/` as the default generator-owned output. Confirm the actual destination and whether retention across `clean` is required.
- Keep current-document production as an explicit integration dependency whose concrete mechanism is unknown; do not assume ordinary compilation already produces springdoc JSON or start business services implicitly.

Consequences:

- No plugin, output directory, or IDE coverage is documented as implemented.
- An independent IDE compiler needs its own verified integration or delegation to the agreed build entry point.
- The final output path and lifecycle details can be chosen during the first tested integration without restoring deferred distribution work.

Alternatives considered:

- Implement CLI and server first. Rejected for current scope because neither establishes the required per-compile update behavior.
- Claim a Maven hook covers every possible compiler invocation. Rejected because the target entry points have not been established.

## 2026-09-09 - Support Microservices And Multiple Documents Per Service

Status: Accepted

Context:

- The user confirms microservices and multiple packages as essential project scenarios, not future extensions.
- The previous single-document workflow did not define service ownership, multiple document inputs, or multi-module compilation coordination.

Decision:

- Generate one Skill per service from one or more explicitly configured required OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON documents. Services update independently in shared or separate repositories.
- Distinguish Java packages, Maven modules, document groups, and services. Existing document producers own package scanning; no source/framework scanner is added to core.
- Require stable serviceId/skillName and service-local documentId values. Namespace operations by service/document/method/path, and schemas/security/references by originating document and pointer.
- Parse each document independently, preserving same-named content and group provenance. Do not merge raw OpenAPI objects, infer equivalence, match references across documents, or invent gateway routing.
- Require all configured documents to be ready for a service update. One failure retains that service's complete previous Skill, emits a warning/status, and permits other services and business compilation to continue.
- Scope staging, replacement, write exclusion, and status to one service; detect output collisions without overwriting results or clearing a shared parent.
- Assign one generation owner per service and verify full, single-service, partial-module, no-change, and parallel compilation. Partial builds with incomplete service inputs must diagnose the missed update rather than publish stale or mixed inputs.
- Explicit document removal removes its references on the next successful service update; missing required input is an update failure, not an implicit deletion.
- Keep global cross-service Skill aggregation, release/version coordination, and cross-repository scheduling deferred.

Consequences:

- Multi-service and multi-document fixtures and integration cases are part of current acceptance, not optional later tests.
- Core adds document provenance and service-level content organization; the proposed Maven integration adds service-level readiness and output ownership. No new platform module is needed.
- Product design v3.4.0 and all active project docs reflect this scope. Generation and integration remain unimplemented.
- Actual module mappings, document production, partial-build entry points, and Maven execution ordering remain unknown and require a target integration test before a complete estimate or coverage claim.

Alternatives considered:

- Restrict current scope to one document only. Rejected because it excludes explicitly required service/group scenarios.
- Produce a Skill for every Java package or Maven module. Rejected because those boundaries do not necessarily represent independently usable APIs.
- Merge every microservice into one global Skill during each service compilation. Deferred because it adds unrelated build dependencies and global freshness coordination.
- Publish a partial service Skill when one document fails. Rejected because it silently removes usable API knowledge or mixes revisions in a result labeled current.

## 2026-09-09 - Establish The Implementation Plan With An Early Integration Gate

Status: Accepted

Context:

- The user asks whether product design is ready and when the work plan will be updated.
- v3.4 defines required service/document scope and failure behavior, while the real document producer, module ordering, and compile entry points are still unverified.

Decision:

- Treat v3.4 as the current implementation planning baseline; do not claim all technical integration choices are settled.
- Maintain one executable P0-P5 plan in TASKS.md: build/test foundation, early integration validation, content conversion, complete safe updates, real compile integration, and frontend acceptance.
- Start with the buildable foundation and investigate current-document/compile feasibility early. Source-independent conversion and update work can proceed on fixtures while target evidence is unavailable.
- Require observed behavior and exact verification results to close stages. Synthetic document producers cannot certify the actual code-to-document production workflow.
- Keep the thin Maven plugin proposal pending actual lifecycle/producer validation; do not introduce new product features or convert the requirement to package-time generation to hide a failed integration assumption.
- Re-estimate remaining work after integration feasibility is established; the earlier single-document estimate is not a committed delivery date.

Consequences:

- Work-plan preparation is complete; no implementation stage is marked complete or started by this documentation task.
- P0 is ready. Missing target configuration gates final integration verification but does not block local core development.
- Product acceptance and implementation status remain distinct, and completed tasks require red-to-green/integration evidence appropriate to the behavior.

Alternatives considered:

- Keep revising product design until every implementation detail is known. Rejected because core requirements are sufficiently bounded and remaining uncertainty is better resolved by concrete probes.
- Build the complete converter/plugin before investigating fresh-document production. Rejected because the highest integration uncertainty should be tested early.
- Mark fixture-only generation as end-to-end completion. Rejected because it does not prove per-compilation freshness or target build behavior.

## 2026-09-09 - Use A Multi-Package Spring Boot Service As The First Realistic Fixture

Status: Accepted

Context:

- The user proposes annotated endpoints in a multi-package Spring Boot test service, multiple OpenAPI 3.1.0 JSON outputs, then Skill implementation.
- This provides realistic producer input but requires explicit grouping and a distinction between fixture export and per-compilation updates.

Decision:

- Select one minimal standalone multi-package test service with two explicit document groups as P1's first realistic fixture, following P0's build/test setup.
- Write assertions for version, group membership, API/field descriptions, and references before completing the matching sample behaviors. Persist only validated sanitized documents and reproducible producer metadata for core tests.
- Use API mappings, explicit OpenAPI annotations, and validation metadata; do not rely on source comments being exported implicitly.
- Keep test-service startup/capture bounded and isolated to fixture generation/integration tests. It does not authorize an implicit production service startup requirement.
- Record the lifecycle distinction: the official springdoc Maven plugin reads a running application during integration-test; its example runs `mvn verify`. A default `mvn package` or `mvn compile` does not by itself demonstrate that export path or satisfy the product compile-update requirement.
- Generate one service Skill from the resulting multiple documents in P2. Continue to verify ordinary compilation freshness/failure handling and separate-service/multi-module cases before closing P1/P4.

Consequences:

- TASKS.md contains the concrete P1 fixture steps; the planned path is `testbeds/springdoc-multi-package/`, not an implemented module.
- The minimal fixture is now selected current work; a full microservice platform remains deferred. No generator or sample code was created by this workflow-clarification task.
- The sample addresses one-service/multiple-package/group coverage; it cannot alone certify independent microservices, reactor order, or production compile-time generation.

## 2026-09-09 - Implement The Standalone Testbed Before Core

Status: Accepted

The user requests the minimal Spring Boot test service first. Advance the independent P1.3 fixture ahead of P0; keep the user's deleted core files unchanged and leave root-reactor repair in P0. This supersedes the earlier sequencing dependency for this standalone probe only.

- Pin Java 17, Spring Boot 3.5.9 and springdoc API-only 2.8.15. The official springdoc 2.8.15 release uses Boot 3.5.9; the actual combination passes our four tests. No UI, persistence, service registry or real authentication is added.
- Use explicit account (user) and business (order/file) package groups. Shared Address and ApiError schemas remain local in each exported document; recursive UserView is preserved.
- Export through a real random loopback port in SpringBootTest with HTTP and fork timeouts and context cleanup. A fixed documented default server address prevents random port differences in snapshots.
- Freeze only asserted documents using an explicit refresh script. Store JSON digests, producer source digests, versions and operation/schema counts. Core will consume these bytes offline; ordinary test runs do not modify frozen files.
- Keep the standalone POM outside the root reactor. Test-phase startup is intentionally confined to this sample; compile does not export documents and no Skill generation or production lifecycle decision is implied.

Evidence: four behavioral failures (404) before controllers/groups, then four passing tests, a passing clean refresh, and successful executable JAR packaging with previously tested code. P1.3 is complete; P0 and the remaining P1/P4 production gates are open.

## 2026-09-09 - Add Swagger UI To The Testbed

Status: Accepted

At the user's request, replace the testbed's API-only starter with `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui:2.8.15`. This supersedes the earlier no-UI constraint for this testbed only. Keep the existing grouped OpenAPI JSON contract and core dependency boundary. The standard `/swagger-ui.html` entry discovers account/business groups automatically; no duplicate group configuration or custom UI is necessary.

Verification: the new HTTP test first failed with 404; after the dependency change all five tests passed. It checks the redirect, HTML, JavaScript resource and exact two-group swagger-config mapping. Fixture refresh passed; both JSON digests remain unchanged, while producer POM metadata is refreshed.

Reference: [springdoc Swagger UI setup](https://springdoc.org/v2/), checked 2026-09-09.

## 2026-09-09 - Deliver Completed Milestones Through GitHub

Status: Accepted

The user requests updated implementation plans and a project commit/push, and authorizes the same delivery sequence for future completed parts. Record the workflow in AGENTS.md: complete the requested slice, verify it, update relevant docs, commit related changes, and perform a normal push to the configured GitHub remote. Report the resulting commit and verification evidence. Missing remote/authentication or a conflict requiring user input is reported without force-pushing. This does not schedule background work or authorize starting unrelated stages.

The current milestone includes the v3.4 scope/docs, previously requested legacy/local-skill removal, the standalone P1.3 producer and Swagger UI. P0 and production integration remain incomplete; the known missing core POM is documented rather than repaired as part of this delivery.

## 2026-09-09 - Establish Minimal Core Input Boundary

Status: Accepted

Use existing managed Jackson/JUnit versions with explicit JUnit 5 discovery. Accept one JSON object with textual openapi exactly 3.1.0; distinguish missing version, unsupported version and invalid JSON. Reject duplicate keys and trailing tokens. This is not full specification validation. No legacy IR is restored. Root tests demonstrate 19-test red-to-green. Proceed to fixture-based P2 separately from unverified production integration.

## 2026-09-09 - Deliver A Fixture-Based Core Skill Before Publication Integration

Status: Accepted

At the user's request, consume the existing account/business snapshots after P0 and render one service Skill. Use a thin JSON tree and retain full operation/schema contract data in Markdown code blocks instead of introducing legacy IR or lossy field summaries. Add effective parameter/server/security context and document-local graph links; recursion remains edges. Keep trusted instructions fixed except validated service/Skill identities, and keep source free text in references.

Core returns an immutable relative-path/content map. Test code exports the sample under target; production writes, complete replacement, locking and compile coordination remain P3/P4. Explicit required map entries fail as a set. Stable safe names and pointer/path hashes isolate files, while a group-aware catalog supplies readable navigation. Reject unsupported reference semantics explicitly and leave broader P2 acceptance open. Input digests identify snapshots and cannot establish compilation freshness.
